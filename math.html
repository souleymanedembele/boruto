<p>All the points involved in the mapping of Fig. 1-1 are inside the ovals. The top oval is called
the domain. That’s the set of elements that we “go out from.” In Fig. 1-1, these elements are
a through <i>f</i>. The bottom oval is called the range. That’s the set of elements that we “come in
toward.” In Fig. 1-1, these elements are v through z.
In any mapping, the elements of the domain and the range can be represented by vari-
ables. A nonspecific element of the domain is called the independent variable. A nonspecific
element of the range is called the dependent variable. The mapping assigns values of the depen-
dent (or “output”) variable to values of the independent (or “input”) variable.

showing how the elements are assigned to each other. The set of ordered pairs defined by the

    Within each ordered pair, an element of the domain (a value of the independent variable)
is written before the comma, and an element of the range (a value of the dependent variable) is
written after the comma. Whenever you can express a mapping as a set of ordered pairs, then
that mapping is called a relation.

                                        <br>
<p>A function is a relation in which every element in the domain maps to one, but never more
than one, element in the range. This is not true of the relation shown in Fig. 1-1. Element c
in the domain maps to three different elements in the range: v, x, and z.
In a function, it’s okay for two or more values of the independent variable to map to a
single value of the independent variable. But it is not okay for a single value of the indepen-
dent variable to map to two or more values of the dependent variable. A function can be
many-to-one, but never one-to-many. Sometimes, in order to emphasize the fact that no value
of the independent variable maps into more than one value of the dependent variable, we’ll
talk about this type of relation as a true function or a legitimate function.
The relation shown in Fig. 1-1 can be modified to make it a function. We must eliminate
two of the three pathways from c in the domain. It doesn’t matter which two we take out. If we
remove the pathways represented by (c,v ) and (c,z ), we get the function illustrated in Fig. 1-2.
    
    <br>   Here’s an informal way to think of the difference between a relation and a function. A rela-
tion correlates things in the domain with things in the range. A function operates on things in the
domain to produce things in the range. A relation merely sits there. A function does something!

                                          Imagine a relation in which the independent variable is called x and the dependent variable is
called y, and for which the domain and range are both the entire set of real numbers (also called
the reals). Our relation is defined as

                                          This is a function between x and y, because there’s never more than one value of y for any value
of x. Mathematicians name functions by giving them letters of the alphabet such as f, g, and
h. In this notation, the dependent variable is replaced by the function letter followed by the
independent variable in parentheses. We can write
